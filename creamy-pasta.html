    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.</li>

        <li>Cook and stir garlic in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat. Add milk, cream cheese, and butter to skillet; stir until smooth.
